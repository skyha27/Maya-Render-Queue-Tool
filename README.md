## Background
This tool was used during the production of the student film *Pull U Once, Shame on Me* for **CSCI 1250 - Introduction to Computer Animation** at Brown University. During the final week of production, our team faced multiple issues rendering on department machines and our school’s render farm, leading to a major bottleneck in our pipeline. 

To fix this problem, I created a tool that allowed us to queue multiple Maya files to be rendered sequentially when our computers were not in use. Each scene’s output is automatically placed into its own folder for organization. This significantly streamlined our workflow and saved the team numerous hours during crunch time.
